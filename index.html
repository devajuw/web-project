      <h1><u>LOCATION OF TOKYO</u></h1>
      <p>
        Tokyo, the bustling capital city of Japan, is strategically positioned
        on the eastern side of Honshu, the country's largest island. This
        location has historically contributed to Tokyo's development into the
        political and economic center of Japan. Nestled within the Kanto region,
        Tokyo boasts a unique blend of ultramodern and traditional, from the
        neon-lit skyscrapers of Shibuya and Shinjuku to the historic temples of
        Asakusa. The city's coastal location on Tokyo Bay has facilitated its
        role as a major international port, connecting Japan with the world.
        Tokyo is enveloped by Chiba Prefecture to the east, Yamanashi Prefecture
        to the west, Kanagawa Prefecture to the south, and Saitama Prefecture to
        the north, creating a sprawling metropolis that extends far beyond its
        central districts. The city's strategic position has also made it a
        cultural hub, where ancient traditions merge with futuristic
        innovations, making Tokyo a symbol of Japan's resilience and its embrace
        of the new. Its geographical placement not only drives Japan's economy
        but also serves as a focal point for travel, inviting millions to
        explore its dynamic blend of heritage and progress.

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Tokyo</strong>, a city where the past and future converge, is home to some of Japan's most iconic heritage sites.
            From the serene Meiji Shrine to the historic Sensō-ji Temple and the majestic Imperial Palace, each site
            offers a unique window into the rich tapestry of Japanese history and culture.

        <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
        <p>
            Tokyo's heritage culture is a vibrant tapestry that interweaves the past and present in a seamless narrative
            that captures the spirit of Japan. At its core, Tokyo's traditional practices and historical sites stand as
            a testament to the city's resilience and commitment to preserving its rich history. From the serene grounds
            of the Meiji Shrine to the ancient paths leading to Sensō-ji Temple, each site is a doorway to understanding
            the complex, layered identity of Tokyo.
        </p>
        <p>
            These landmarks are not merely relics to be admired; they are active centers of cultural significance. They
            host festivals that burst with color and life, bringing together communities to celebrate seasons and
            traditions unchanged by time. The meticulously preserved buildings and gardens offer a silent narrative of
            the city's transformation from a feudal society to a leading global metropolis. In Tokyo, heritage culture
            is not just about preservation—it's about living history that continues to influence and inspire the rhythms
            of daily life in this dynamic city.
